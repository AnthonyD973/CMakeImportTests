# StepMania

The source code of this executable was taken from commit `0943fb4a5a6d8efa7772ccd3b5def72842de8d9a` of the [StepMania repo](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania) (licensed under MIT). Official website of StepMania [here](https://www.stepmania.com/).

This source code is here only for demonstration purposes; the purpose of the CMakeBestPractices repo is to demonstrate how to write a buildsystem for a C++ project or superproject; see the CMakeBestPractices repo's main `README.md` file for an explanation. In fact, we've essentially rebuilt StepMania's existing CMake buildsystem from scratch to align with CMakeBestPractices's purposes.
